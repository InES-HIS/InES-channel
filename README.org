#+title: InES Channel

* What is this about?
A guix channel to ease InES developments.

** Why a separate channel?
Although upstreaming FLOSS packages is the right way to go, getting patches merged may be a somewhat cumbersome process.  Hence we provide our own channel here to get things faster up-and-running.
