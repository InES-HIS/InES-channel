#+title: InES Channel

* What is this about?
A guix channel to ease InES developments.

** Why a separate channel?
Although upstreaming FLOSS packages is the right way to go, getting patches merged may be a somewhat cumbersome process.  Hence we provide our own channel here to get things faster up-and-running.

* How To
** Use this channel
Add the base information for this channel to your personal `~/.config/guix/channels.scm` file.  It should look something like this:

#+begin_src scheme
  (cons* (channel
          (name 'ines)
          (url "https://github.com/InES-HIS/InES-channel")
          (branch "main"))
         %default-channels)
#+end_src
